<p>There is significant value in providing  an online resource library  within any website. From improving customer service, to conversion (sales), to <a href="#">SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</a>, and more, the value of an online resource library is immeasurable and priceless; often regardless of the company's industry or focus.</p>
<p>Building an <a title="Online Resources" href="#" target="_blank">Online Resource Library</a> section for a company's website can seem tedious and time consuming; when handled in a phased, long-term approach, it's actually quite easy.</p>
<p>Depending on the business and industry, website resources can range from such topics as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Industry Jargon Definitions</li>
  <li>Demo Videos</li>
  <li>How-To Guides</li>
  <li>Tips On Caring For Product</li>
  <li>Getting the Most from Services</li>
  <li>Industry Related News</li>
  <li>Consumer Testimonials</li>
  <li>Case Studies</li>
  <li>Discussion Boards</li>
  <li>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)</li>
  <li>Additional Product or Service Appendices &amp; Specifications</li>
  <li>and so on . . .</li>
</ul>
<p>Building an online resource section can help sell new prospects, help service current clients, and help with SEO (due to the encyclopedic nature of a resource section filled with related keywords, phrases, and rich content). </p>
<p>As well, when a resource section is updated periodically, over time in a phased approach, such new additions and updates help to satisfy <a href="#">fresh content for SEO</a> purposes.</p>
<p>Overall, there are numerous benefits to having one, or more, resource library sections  devoted to education and information about the company's industry, products and services; anything that helps promote and inform.</p>
<p><strong><em>To ignore developing a resource library(ies) for a website is to miss out on a huge opportunity!</em></strong></p>
<h4>Baby Steps, Build Over Time Without Stress</h4>
<p>A resource library is something that can start small, then built over time as more information becomes available. Start small with <a title="Frequently Asked Questions on Neturf Web Services" href="#" target="_blank">FAQ's</a> or recent industry related <a title="Neturf Newsletter" href="#" target="_blank">articles</a>, <a title="Centralized Help Database for Neturf Web Services" href="#" target="_blank">help tips</a>, and so on. Over time, the website's resource library will begin building itself with numerous industry related articles, how-to's, FAQ's and more. </p>
<p>Having a  wealth of ever-changing and updated content is positive in the eyes of search engines, as well as consumers; both want to see fresh content to peak interest. </p>
<p>Constant and regular updates show that a website attempts to stay current and relevant.  Google gives   higher <a title="Understanding How Search Engines Rank Your Website" href="https://www.neturf.com/products/search_engine_ranking_basics.htm" target="_blank">ranking in search results</a> to recently updated sites, versus those websites that are rarely updated, or <a title="The Importance of Keeping Your Website Content Updated" href="https://www.neturf.com/products/fresh_content_seo_ranking.htm" target="_blank">contain stale and out-dated information</a>.</p>
<h4>An Informed Customer Is A Good Customer</h4>
<p>Providing a wealth of pertinent information is essential to any  company's success from a consumer's point of view. An online resource library allows  consumers and prospects the opportunity to make an informed buying decision. </p>
<p>When a customer is informed, they are more likely to <a title="Converting Online Visitors to Sales" href="https://www.neturf.com/products/converting_online_visitors_to_sales.htm">convert into a sale</a>, and less likely to experience buyer's remorse.  Ultimately, the customer will feel confident in the buying decision, and choosing the company that provided such details. </p>
<p>In addition, most will agree that a properly informed and educated customer is much easier to work with, than a customer who is ill-informed, or lacks the knowledge needed to make an informed, positive buying decision. </p>
<p>By providing the customer the information necessary to educate themselves, a website's resource section allows employees more time to focus on assisting the customer versus educating the customer; provided all the  information on the company's website is legitimate and accurate.</p>
<p>Often informed and happy customers will provide  positive reviews and free advertising via word-of-mouth; or today's equivalent, <a href="http://www.neturf.com/products/how_to_advertise_on_social_media_part_1.htm" title="Developing an Effective Social Media Ad Campaign" target="_blank">social media posts and shares</a>.</p>
<h4>Excellent For Search Engine Ranking</h4>
<p>Search engines such as <a title="Getting Top Ranking In Google" href="https://www.neturf.com/products/receiving_maintaining_top_search_ranking.htm" target="_blank">Google</a> have one main goal when it comes to ranking search results:</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em> To provide visitors with the most relevant information to the search.</em></strong></p>
<p>Therefore, in order for a website to come up first in search results, that website must have a great deal of descriptive, relevant information on the topic  searched. In essence, the website must be an &quot;encyclopedia&quot; on a topic.</p>
<p>The best way to accomplish such a feat, especially in today's world with thousands of competitive websites in any given industry, is to include an online resource library. </p>
<p>A site that is  an &quot;encyclopedia&quot; on a particular topic,  is going to get better ranking due to a wealth of keyword related information available. Websites with such archives of important information are going to rank better for related searches compared to websites that lack  such a mass of information on a given topic. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Most &quot;encyclopedia&quot; type websites often receive first page ranking; in fact most receive first or second place listing, for searches. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting such high ranking in search results happens because having a library of relevant information using descriptive, <a title="Using Your Website Keywords &amp; Phrases Effectively" href="https://www.neturf.com/products/keyword_tune-up.htm"> related keywords and phrases</a> throughout the site is paramount to good search engine optimization (SEO).</p>
<p>If a descriptive keyword or phrase is not listed or mentioned within a website's content, then that site will not appear naturally in search results for that particular key term or phrase unless <a href="http://www.neturf.com/products/online_marketing.htm" title="Using Paid Advertising Campaigns For Immediate Sales" target="_blank">using paid advertising</a>.</p>
<p>In addition,  linking to sections of the website's resource library from social media helps to build a stream of relevant incoming website links. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For instance posting on social media (such as <a href="http://facebook.com/neturf?v=info" title="Neturf Solutions Facebook Page" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/neturf-solutions" title="Neturf Solutions LinkedIN Page" target="_blank">LinkedIN</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/neturf" title="Neturf Solutions Twitter Page" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.alignable.com/west-linn-or/neturf" title="Neturf Solutions on Alignable" target="_blank">Alignable</a>, or <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/+Neturf" title="Neturf Solutions Google+ Page" target="_blank">Google+</a>) about a Tip, Gallery Portfolio, or News Article each day, and providing a link to the page on the website with more information. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These incoming links will help raise the website's ranking in search engines as legitimate websites, and hence improve SEO.</p>
<h4>Fosters Goodwill In The Industry</h4>
<p> Developing a resource library is also a good means of promoting goodwill with customers, prospects and other supporting industry professionals. </p>
<p>Often sites offering free, &quot;useful&quot; information to anyone, regardless of cost or membership, are seen as attractive and worthy of return visits. As well,  sites with such valuable information are often passed around amongst related industry professionals, and viewed as a good &quot;go-to&quot; guide.</p>
<p>Most people  appreciate the wealth of information and honesty provided by a company's resource section, and  prefer to do business with such  upfront companies when  needs arise.</p>
<h4>Everyone Wants To Link To Useful Websites</h4>
<p>When a website provides a wealth of quality information, people will link and post on social media about it. There's no stopping it, nor should a company want to stop such valuable incoming links. </p>
<p><a title="Tips on How to Use Link Trades Effectively" href="https://www.neturf.com/products/improve_seo_with_proper_link_building.htm" target="_blank">Incoming links</a> vary from social media posts,  news articles, blogs, other websites and so on. These incoming links are important to building a website's organic traffic base. As well, incoming links are known to improve ranking in search engines. </p>
<p>As noted above, search engines take note of how many &quot;incoming&quot; links a website has. Websites with more incoming links are given more &quot;points&quot; per se, in their overall SEO score. The more points, the better ranking that website will receive when searches are performed related to that website's topic.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Thus the theory goes, the more quality incoming links a company's website has, the better placement the site will receive in search results on Google, and other search engines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And best of all, incoming links provide the business with free traffic. The majority of the traffic is most likely potential prospects and qualified sales leads. If someone invests the time to follow a link and learn more, there is some level of interest.</p>
<h4>Begin Developing a Resource Library Now</h4>
<p>There are many important and inherent values to implementing an online resource library regardless of industry. Whether the goal is to better educate  customers, improve  search ranking, foster goodwill, generate more incoming traffic, or all of the above; providing an <a title="Neturf Resources Main Menu" href="http://www.neturf.com/website_resources/index.htm" target="_blank">online resource library</a> is a key factor to promoting a healthy and successful website.</p>
